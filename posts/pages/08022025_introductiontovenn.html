        <p class="inline-quote">There is no greater mistake than assuming Venn was made for us. <br> -Unattributed Tholovenar saying</p>
        <p class="justified-paragraph">Venn is the world and setting of <em>Dissimilands</em>, larger than Earth, and home to a grand patchwork of magicks, peoples, and the eponymous dissimilands. This blog post will serve as a starting point for those wanting to understand the world <em>Dissimilands</em> was written for. Thus, it will be divided into these parts:</p>
        <ul class="content-list">
        <li>Geography</li>
        <li>Magick</li>
        <li>Peoples</li>
        <li>Gods</li>
        <li>Dissimilands</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Geography of Venn</h2>
        <p class="justified-paragraph">Venn, as a planet, is slightly larger than Earth. Surrounding it are three moons: Mal, the largest, Veos, a golden moon, and Prinn, a blasted black rock. On Venn there is one continent, the Host. For deeper information on the Host and its geography, read any subsequent posts on tectonics that are sure to be posted.</p>
        <h2>The Magicks of Venn</h2>
        <p class="justified-paragraph">Venn is home to a bogglingly large amount of magick, very much at one end of the 'kitchen sink' scale. In fact, the nature of magick is such that <em>everything</em> has its own magick, it is simply unfeasible, unnecessary, or not worth it to seek it all out. In-universe this is labeled the Theory of Magick. <br><br> Magicks are often divided into four categories: </p>
        <ul class="content-list">
        <li>Major: possessing major infrastructure for its practice, learning, and study.</li>
        <li>Minor: possessing infrastructure to learn or practice.</li>
        <li>Bloodline: passing only through lineage.</li>
        <li>Abandoned: forgotten or intentionally lost.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="justified-paragraph">Examples of each, in order, include: iron magick, particular magick, ossimorphy, and copper magick. While I would love to delve into the many magicks, or even list them all, that will be for later posts. For now I'll delve into these four and what makes them fit into their own given categories.<br><br>Iron magick has been used heavily since it was discovered. At its most simple, it allows for telekinetic control over iron (ferrokinesis) with constraints on concentration and range. This has obvious combat utility, but beyond that is used extensively in construction and in shipments. Being able to carry large quantities of goods or very heavy objects is a wondrous utility power. Thusly, it possesses its own arcanaeum (Ferrofortress), it has many academies and trade schools that include courses or tracks dedicated to it, and iron mages are a major part of the global development.<br><br>Particular magick is an ancient practice that dates back to the beginning of magick. Despite this, it remains a minor magick. No doubt there are those who study it. In fact many of those steeped in magick are intensely familiar, and it would be incredibly rare for an expert level magus to not have any interaction with it. Particular magick relies on self-discovery, and observation of environmental truths. This allows for the development of a solespell: a unique spell that grows alongside its practitioner. Many theorize that this was how many schools of magick were discovered. Particular magick has infrastructure but it remains esoteric and difficult to teach, thus it is minor.<br><br>Ossimorphy is a magick primarily held within the Kephler family, though offshoots do exist. It was first borne out of magickal experimentation of a Kephler ancestor involving the consumption of dragon's marrow. Having secured this ability, it was only discovered to a bloodline magick years later. Following intense frustration at being unable to recreate or teach the magick, the man's children inherited his same ability: gradual skeletal structure morphing. In the contemporary era there are thousands of ossimorphs. Typically they operate as plastic surgeons or other forms of enhancement work.<br><br>The tragedy of copper magick is deserving of its own page. The magick was once practiced globally, a school on the rise and ready to thrust Vennic society into a more modern age. The dissimation (will be discussed later in this post) of copper magick sent the world back decades as critical infrastructure failed. Many steps towards electric reliance were dashed and communication once again became laborious. Copper magick once allowed for long-distance transmission.</p>
        <h2>The People of Venn</h2>
        <p class="justified-paragraph">Venn's peoples are almost as vast as its magicks. With roughly 33 races, each with vibrant and individual cultures, this world is much more complex than our own. To be transparent about the process of creation, I have largely not placed these peoples on the map yet, given that the map doesn't exist. I want cultures to be defined by geography and circumstance, so once I've finalized the Host, then I will be able to make more posts about the peoples of Venn in detail. But to generalize, I'll go through the large classifications: the species.</p>
        <h3>Humanae</h3>
        <p class="justified-paragraph">The humanae-or more commonly, just humans-comprise around a third of Venn. Though through cultural impact, one wouldn't be blamed for assuming more. Humans are the chosen people of the god Yeshalla, and thus subject to her same curse of being ever-seeking. Humans can vary widely, from the dwarves under the surface, to the elves in their trees. As the origin of gentle civilization, humans hold a considerable amount of political and cultural sway.</p>
        <h3>Beastiae</h3><p class="justified-paragraph">Being the most populous species by a large margin, simply by how varied their forms are, beastfolk carry with them the traits and burdens of the lesser animals. Inhabiting nearly every city, and living far across the Host, beastfolk are often the foundation for many cultures and traditions.</p>
        <h3>Fae</h3><p class="justified-paragraph">The fae are magickal begins born out of the long dream of Maihom. They are much rarer than humans or beastfolk, but not so out of place as to be marginalized in most societies. Often times fae bear resemblance to the human races, though with understandably stand-out affects or abilities that go beyond their human counterparts.</p>
        <h3>Artifex</h3><p class="justified-paragraph">The artifex are the most recent of peoples to walk Venn. They emerge from the creations of society, whether intentionally or not. Only as technology has progressed have these beings begun to become more common. They live within a tenuous relationship with the rest of Venn.</p>
        <h3>Coalescents</h3><p class="justified-paragraph">Coalescents aren't organic in the way most are, but rather being born out of an accumulation of magick surrounding natural processes. Often deemed elementals, they live on the edges of society, often in their own cloisters inhospitable to inorganic life. Though, it is not inconceivable to see one walk the streets of any metropolis.</p>
        <h3>Zoneborn</h3><p class="justified-paragraph">The zoneborn are odd beings emerged from the dissimilands. Usually as an unexpected outcome of degenerate magick, they often possess unorthodox appearances and abilities, thus they are marginalized. Both by society and by the god Jaught, who holds a sadistic hatred for them.</p>
        <h3>The Margins</h3><p class="justified-paragraph">These people don't solely belong to one species or another. This includes any half-races, but also the cherubim and devilment, who were born out of union with extraplanar entities that have since vanished from Venn.</p>
        <h2>The Gods of Venn</h2>
        <p class="justified-paragraph">Venn and its adjunct planes are walked by many gods, gods who are by their nature, just people. This won't go over that plethora of them, but rather their role in the world of Venn.<br><br>The gods of Venn take a much more heavy handed role than in some other settings. They have personal motivations, joys, friends. The very magick dedicated to extracting power from the gods, theurgy, is primarily focused on fostering a working relationship. Largely, no god has desired to rule a kingdom, though that has been different in the past, and the god Semerlane brushes against this with this Silver Throne and Silver Court. Jaught lives on the moon Mal, where he watches and guards the planet against degenerate magicks. Hurlun lives within the core of Venn, and occasionally comes up to commune with those subsurface communities of dwarves and the like. Avid naturalists might encounter Siema a multitude of times in their lives, as she wanders the wilds of Venn. Though they may be alien to us, every god has a motivation and a passion, and understanding that helps to understand the god.</p>
        <h3>Minor Divinities</h3>
        <p class="justified-paragraph">Aside from the major gods, their are minor divinities scattered everywhere. Spirits of groves, patron gods of towns, living rivers, and sleeping mountains. These minor divinities can be much less 'people' than the other gods, but they still are conscious, and sources of divine power.</p>
        <h2>The Dissimilands</h2>
        <p class="justified-paragraph">And we've arrived here, at the core of what makes <em>Dissimilands</em> its own. These are what started the desire to make this a TTRPG in the first place. Heavily inspired by Alexander Wales' exclusion zones, these are ares where magick has been contained by the god, Jaught. These degenerate, world-threatening magicks are unable to be truly erased, so they are held by these dissimilands. Often they provide Zones of Adventure. Places where treasures and perils gather in droves. To the world, though, they are proof that Venn is dying.<br><br>The dissimilands claim more and more magick as time moves forward, swallowing useful, even necessary magicks. Some see Jaught as overly liberal in his dissiming, some see him as necessary, most see that Venn is declining.</p><h3>How do they work?</h3>
        <p class="justified-paragraph">There are varieties to the dissimilands. Some claim entire schools, some contain only specific aspects, some center around artifacts and some center around single entities. Societies can be built in dissimilands-and they have been-as these places allow for magicks nowhere else can use. One example is the Scaffold, the only place where cosmorphy may be practiced after its dissimation. Dissimilands are incredibly varied, and many aren't even dangerous. They are a fact of life, growing to cover more and more of the surface of Venn as time leads on.</p>
        <h2>Closing Up</h2>
        <p class="justified-paragraph">This has just been a broad overview, a post to get you read up on what <em>Dissimilands</em> and Venn is all about. I hope you stick around, more posts are soon to come!</p>
