        <h1>About <em>Dissimilands</em></h1>
        <p class="inline-quote">What happens when a world was not built to be balanced? When every innovation brings the risk of tipping past the edge?</p>
        <p class="justified-paragraph"><em>Dissimilands</em> is a system and setting dedicated to original magick systems, loopholes, and what happens when they break. The system contains a plethora of magicks and races to allow for truly unique characters. It is a lived-in world where magick goes far beyond combat and problem solving goes deeper than fists.</p>
        <h2>Who's behind <em>Dissimilands</em>?</h2>
        <p class="justified-paragraph">My name is Isaiah Engle and I am an artist, writer, worldbuilder, and TTRPG designer-aspirant. <em>Dissimilands</em> began as a simple worldbuilding project, heavily inspired by the likes of <em>Worth the Candle</em> and other works of rational fiction. It expanded into this system, built to explore the world of Venn and its many magicks. This site is part devlog, part archive, and part journal.</p>
